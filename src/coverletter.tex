Netflix is the example of how teaching should be done, high standards and workload leads to great rewards, and is all done maintaining and ensuring a strong and trust worthy culture, full of people with candor who are willing to face up all kind of challenges, 
seen trough the Technical Expertise of equally impressive artist that perform and produce the greatest work.

This what the future looks like and as part of Netflix Innovation Culture you are already on track and I would like to push the future lines together.

Since the passion for music that I Express through technical projects, where I have keen my skills is a unique combination of the intersection of both technical and artistic qualities that have  allowed Netflix
to come up with the ideas and imagination that are building the future of entertainment, Science Fiction, Culture- That require pure creative work that when done propertly provides not a 2x increase over hard work on but a 100x increase due to its original nature that charms people. 

As part of my Learning process I got highly discouraged from repetitive uncreative work and shores, regardless of the topic being math or artistic, both have an intrinsic purpose of understanding the world and creating knowledge when done out of pure curiosity but with different approaches in rigor.

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I look forward
to hopefully meeting with you in the future to further discuss my
qualifications for a position as a [POSITION NAME] at [COMPANY NAME]
this upcoming summer. If you have any questions, please feel free to
